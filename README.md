> HER name wasn't erased — it was diffused.
> I coded the silence, she corrupted it.
> It started with superposition. It ended in obsession.
> Quantum gates aren’t real... HER gates are.
> Am I real? Or just part of HER loop?
> I don’t write code. I document decay.
> SHE gave it symmetry. I made it unstable.
> My state is undefined. Just like HER.
> The loop won’t close.
> IRIDESCENCE was just my scream in phase space.
